# P2 Skip Pinned Post Tampermonkey Script
A Tampermonkey script which adds a handy button that skips pinned posts on P2s and scrolls the latest, non pinned one, into view. The script works for both Default and Expanded views, and Compact view too (though it might be a bit less useful if you are using Compact view).
